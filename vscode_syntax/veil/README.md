# veil

**veil** is a lightweight programming language that compiles to JavaScript.  
This VS Code extension provides **syntax highlighting** for `.veil` files so your code doesn’t look like plain text anymore.

Version: **0.0.1**

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for `.veil` files  
- Clear distinction between keywords, variables, functions, strings, and comments  
- Designed specifically around the veil language syntax  

> Tip: This extension focuses purely on highlighting. Compilation to JavaScript is handled by the veil compiler, not the extension.

## Requirements

None.  
Just install the extension and open any file ending with `.veil`.

## Extension Settings

This extension currently has **no configurable settings**.  
It just works™.

## Known Issues

- This is an early release (0.0.1), so edge cases in highlighting may exist  
- No semantic highlighting yet  
- No IntelliSense or autocomplete (planned for later)

If you find something broken, opening an issue is appreciated.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

- Initial release  
- Basic syntax highlighting for `.veil` files

## Working with veil in VS Code

- Make sure your files use the `.veil` extension

- Pair this with the veil compiler to run or bundle your code as JavaScript
